/**
 * This specific package is meant to test compatibility between collections in SquidLib and collections in OpenJDK.
 * As such, it uses tests from the GPL2-licensed OpenJDK 7 sources to ensure the same test quality is upheld all around.
 * That means this package, and this package only, is licensed under the GPL, version 2, with the classpath exception,
 * which is available in PACKAGE_LICENSE.txt in this directory. The tests are not distributed with SquidLib as a library
 * or Maven dependency, so there's no effect on the rest of the code.
