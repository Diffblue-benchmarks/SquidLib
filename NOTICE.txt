Portions of Bresenham methods are derived from Bob Pendletons C algorithm, which is in turn derived from Paul Heckberts algorithm ("Digital Line Drawing" from "Graphics Gems", Academic Press, 1990.

Portions of FOV and LOS classes are derived from works by Steven Blacken originally distributed as part of the Blacken Library for roguelike games under the Apache 2.0 license.

Portions of some classes are derived from works by Jice orginally distributed in the libtcod library under the BSD license with the statement provided below in this document.

The @Beta annotation is from Google's Guava library under the Apache 2.0 license.

The JRotation class is based on code by Savvas Dalkitsis on stackoverflow.com.

The RNG class is based on the Mersenne Twister implementation by Daniel Dyer as part of the Uncommons Maths library, which is in turn based on the original C algorithm by Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura.
