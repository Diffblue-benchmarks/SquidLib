Thanks to TSMI and notostraca (Tommy Ettinger) of #rgrd for help in developing SquidLib.

Portions of Bresenham methods are derived from Bob Pendletons C algorithm, which is in turn derived from Paul Heckberts algorithm ("Digital Line Drawing" from "Graphics Gems", Academic Press, 1990.

Portions of FOV and LOS classes are derived from works by Steven Blacken originally distributed as part of the Blacken Library for roguelike games under the Apache 2.0 license.

Portions of some classes are derived from works by Jice originally distributed in the libtcod library under the BSD license with the statement provided below in this document.

Portions of some classes are derived from works in the rot.js library with the statement provided below in this document.

The @Beta annotation is from Google's Guava library under the Apache 2.0 license.

The JRotation class is based on code by Savvas Dalkitsis on stackoverflow.com.

The RNG class is based on the Mersenne Twister implementation by Daniel Dyer as part of the Uncommons Maths library, which is in turn based on the original C algorithm by Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura.

The squidpony.squidgrid.mapping.styled package and the JSON resources are derived from Sean T. Barrett's Herringbone Wang Tiles library, part of the nothings set of libraries, which were released into the public domain.

The LightRNG class is based on SplitMix64.c by Sebastiano Vigna, released into the public domain and made available on http://xorshift.di.unimi.it/

The XorRNG class is based on the C implementation of XorShift 128+ by Sebastiano Vigna, released into the public domain and made available on http://xorshift.di.unimi.it/

The PermutedRNG class is based on the aforementioned SplitMix64.c by Sebastiano Vigna and on the paper, http://www.pcg-random.org/paper.html , describing PCG-Random and its methodology written by Melissa E. O'Neill.

The SobolQRNG class and the resource in the resources/qrng folder were ported from Apache Commons Math, where Stephen Joe and Frances Kuo are credited for the implementation.

The NeuralParticle and WeightedLetterNamegen classes are based on work by Ebyan Alvarez-Buylla

The DijkstraMap class is original but owes substantial credit to Edsger Dijkstra
for creating the algorithm that shares his name, Brian Pender and Joshua Day for
pioneering Progressive Dijkstra Scan, and the IRC user known as kaw for a
Clojure-language implementation that would help shape this design.

The Spill class derives much of its implementation from DijkstraMap but also from
techniques Joshua Day described for using randomized floodfill and a Lua implementation related to his postings on the subject.

The SoundMap class also derives much of its implementation from DijkstraMap but
is otherwise practically novel.

The squidpony.squidai.AOE interface and its implementing classes are essentially
made possible by the Progressive Dijkstra Scan technique, so more thanks must go
to Brian Pender and Joshua Day.

Small but important bugfixes and additions were contributed by Ivan PolozhÄ“ntsev
( https://github.com/uzername/ , introduced the concept and some code for
SquidKeys.ignoreInput), David Becker (found and fixed several GDX-related bugs),
and Shane Chubb (found and fixed a bug in the LibGDX TextCellFactory).
This is not a complete list of bugfix contributors.

All of the TrueType and bitmap fonts in src/main/resources were made by Tommy
Ettinger and released into the public domain.
